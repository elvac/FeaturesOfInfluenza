## Project Brief
This was a meaningful project which was to prepare a medical staffing plan for a domestic medical staffing company in US for the coming year, particularly for influenza season when medical staffs would be in high demand. Before that, it was necessary to clarify the features of influenza. The outputs of this phase of the project were expected to tell the crucial features of influenza which would be trend predicting preparation for the coming year.

## Data Sets
The project would use datasets sourced from CDC including influenza deaths by multi-dimensions (geography, time, age and gender), counts of influenza laboratory test results by state and survey of flu shot rates in children. Population data by geography sourced from US Census Bureau would be used as well.  
**Challenges:** Datasets had missing and inconsistent values.  
**Limitations:** Part of influenza death data was suppressed might skew the dataset distribution. Lack of flu shot rates for other age group except children, makes the analysis of the flu shot rates impacts become impossible.

## Analytical Methods
After read project brief and quickly browsed data sets, I focused on the possible vital factors which might impact on the prediction of staffing needs for coming flu season. Based on it, I listed the questions and mainly used **descriptive analysis**, **correlation analysis** and **statistical hypothesis testing** to answer them:  
- When was the flu season?  
- What variables influenced on the flu visits or deaths?   
- What were the relationship between flu visits and deaths?  
- What was the trend of flu over time?       
- How differently did flu distribute in different states?    

## Outputs
The outputs of the data analysis revealed all crucial features of influenza, in order to provide foundation for the predicting of staffing needs. They included Excel files for analytical process and a final visualization report.
