# FeaturesOfInfluenza
Using statistical methods to reveal the features of Influenza

## Project Brief
This was a meaningful project which was to prepare a medical staffing plan for a domestic medical staffing company in US for the coming year, particularly for influenza season when medical staffs would be in high demand. Before that, it was necessary to clarify the features of influenza. The outputs of this phase of the project were expected to tell the crucial features of influenza which would be trend predicting preparation for the coming year.

## Data Set
The project would use datasets sourced from CDC including influenza deaths by multi-dimensions (geography, time, age and gender), counts of influenza laboratory test results by state and survey of flu shot rates in children. Population data by geography sourced from US Census Bureau would be used as well.  
Challenges: Datasets were not clean.  
Limitations: Part of influenza data was suppressed. Lacked of flu shot rates for other age group except children.

## Analytical Methods
In this project, statistical analysis was mainly used, including descriptive analysis, statistical hypothesis testing and correlation analysis. Finally, used Tableau to visualize the insights.

## Outputs
Based on the historical data, the outputs tells influenza features on multi-dimensions, including seasonality, geography, and age.
